Thanks for coming by! This is repo goes along with a talk I give at TechReady, "Unity3D, Zombies and Games for Windows, Phone and Xbox". If you haven't seen the talk, you may not be overly interested in the repo here.

## The Kart Racing Game (TR20)


[You can go and play the game right in your browser](http://tr20unity.azurewebsites.net/)! The Kart racing game consists of three major pieces: A terrain built using Unity's own terrain tools (dressed up with better textures and tree models), the new Car controller (again, dressed up with a different model), and two scripts making up the "shooting bomb". The two scripts I wrote on stage can be found in the `TR20 Source` folder.

## A simple FPS (TR18 & TR19)
I built slightly different shooters in both presentations, but the concept is the same: You start with building a terrain using Unity's built-in terrain tools (dressed up with better textures and tree models) and put in a character controller (using Unity's own FPS controller). You then give the controller the ability to "shoot" a ball by adding a simple script - and a box the ability to explode by also adding a simple script. The scripts I wrote on stage can be found in the `TR19 Source` folder.
